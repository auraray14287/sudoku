Sudoku Solver (Go)

A command-line Sudoku solver written in Go.
It takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as 9 separate string arguments and prints the solved puzzle in a specific output format.
Invalid inputs or unsolvable puzzles result in Error output.
How It Works

    Accepts exactly 9 arguments, each representing a row of the Sudoku board.
    Each row must be exactly 9 characters long.
    Digits 1-9 are pre-filled cells, . represents an empty cell.
    Validates that the starting grid has no duplicate digits in any row, column, or 3Ã—3 subgrid.
    Uses backtracking to solve the puzzle.
    Prints the solved grid if successful, otherwise prints Error.

Usage
Run from the module root

go run . "<row1>" "<row2>" "<row3>" "<row4>" "<row5>" "<row6>" "<row7>" "<row8>" "<row9>"
